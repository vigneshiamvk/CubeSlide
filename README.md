# CubeSlide

A simple game written with C# and Unity. I'm still trying to find my way around with Unity and so this game is extremely simple ( I'm predominantly an [artist](www.vigneshkrishnan.com) ) If you were expecting something grand, sorry! :satisfied:

# How to play?

Download the CubeSlide.app file from the Executables folder. Run the application and enjoy! :)

# Going through the source files

Clone the repository and import it into Unity. The scripts are pretty straightforward, and anyone with a basic knowledge of Unity, 3D and C# should be comfortable playing with the files.
